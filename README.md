# 2048 Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to combine tiles with the same value to reach the 2048 tile.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.
- When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into one, and the value is doubled.
- The goal is to create a tile with the value `2048`. Once you achieve that, you win the game!
- If there are no more valid moves and the grid is full, the game is over.
